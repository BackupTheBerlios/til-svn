brainstorming for plugin tests:

abstract: unittests with CUnit or another framework are not suited for testing the correct functionality of a plugin. It would be better to have a small app (that can run automatically) which can be filled with <key, expected commands> pairs like:

hit :: <UP> :: move (row, 1, prev|rel|virtual)
press :: <SHIFT>
hit :: <LEFT> :: select (normal) :: move (character, 1, prev|rel|wrap)
release :: <SHIFT>
hit :: <RIGHT> :: select (none) :: move (character, 1, rel|wrap)
press :: A :: replace (A)
pressrep :: A :: replace (A)
release :: A
